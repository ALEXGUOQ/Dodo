# A notification bar for iOS written in Swift

This is a UI widget for showing notification messages in iOS apps.

* It has built-in style presets for common types of messages: success, info, warning and error.
* The bar can have buttons with custom tap handlers.
* Bar styles can be customized.
* Includes animations for showing and hiding the bar which can be customized.

## Usage

### Show notification bar


```Swift
view.dodo.success("Everybody has won and all must have prizes.")
view.dodo.info("Extinction is the rule. Survival is the exception.")
view.dodo.warning("This world is but a canvas to our imagination.")
view.dodo.error("The perception of beauty is a moral test.")

```

Note: if there is an existing notification bar in a UIView it will be replaced by the new one.


### Hide notification bar

```Swift
view.dodo.hide()
```

### Styling

```Swift
view.dodo.style.label.color = UIColor.whiteColor()
view.dodo.style.label.font = UIFont.preferredFontForTextStyle(UIFontTextStyleBody)
view.dodo.style.bar.backgroundColor = DodoColor.fromHexString("#00000090")
view.dodo.style.bar.cornerRadius = 10
```
